File permission in Linux
- Used to secure and protect file data by controlling who can access and modify files and directory

Type of permission :-
    ->r(read) - permission to view/read the content 
    -w(write) - permission to modify/creating/deleting the content and renaming files within a directory
    -x(execute) - enable running a file as a program or accessing the contents of a directory

file/directory permission representation :-
    -> the first line character indicate the type of file[ - for regular files, d for directories, l for link  ]
    -> the next nine characters represent permission, grouped into three sets of three ::==
        => First 3 ::: User/Owner permission
        => Middle 3 ::: Group permission
        => Last 3 ::: Other permission

Modify the peemission (chmod) :-
    Used to change the file and directory permissions
    
    1. Symbolic Mode -
        -> + :: add a permission
        -> - :: remove a permission
        -> = :: set a specific permission, overridding existing permission
        eg:- 
            # give execute permission to user ---- chmod u+x f1.txt
            # give write permission to group ---- chmod g+w f1.txt
            # remove execute permission for others ---- chmod o-x f1.txt
            # remove all permission for others ---- chmod o-rwx f1.txt
            # give all permission to the group ---- chmod g+rwx f1.txt

    2. Numeric Mode
        
        0	No permissions
        1	Execute only
        2	Write only
        4	Read only
        
        3	Write + Execute
        5	Read + Execute
        6	Read + Write
        7	Read + Write + Execute

        eg:-
            # Give execute permission to all (ugo+x) -
            chmod 111 f1.txt

            # Give write permission to all (ugo+w)
            chmod 222 f1.txt

            # User: rwx, Group: rw, Others: rx
            chmod 765 f1.txt

            # User: r, Group: rx, Others: rw
            chmod 456 f1.txt

            # Give full permissions to everyone
            chmod 777 f1.txt

            # Remove all permissions from User & Group, but allow Others full access
            chmod 007 f1.txt
