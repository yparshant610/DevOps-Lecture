cat :-
    a fundamental utility in Linux used for reading, combining, and creating text files.
      1. create a file -

      3. concatenate multiple files -
         cat file-name-1 file-name-2
      4. Merge Files -
         cat file-name-1 file-name-2 > file-name-to-give-to-merged-file
      5. write something in a file -
         cat >> file-name
      6. append content(i.e., adds text from one file or standard input to the end of another existing file) -
         cat source-file >> destination-file
         - can be use to append multiple files

tail :-
    displays the end of a file. It also defaults to 10 lines.
     {tail file-name}
