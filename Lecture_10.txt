Working with Link files
    There are two types of link files in linux:
        1. Hard Link
        2. Soft Link(Symbolic Link)
    ##########
    Hard Link
    ##########
        for degister recovery
        1. Create a hard link-
            { ln <file_to_link> <file_to_which_it_link> }
        2. To check inode numbers-
            { ls -li }

    ##########
    Soft Link
    ##########
        This is like a shortcut of a file if original file is tempered the shortcut file also shows changes
        1. Create a symbolic link
            { ln -s <original_file> <soft_link_file> }
            in original_file we will give the full path also to access it
    
Task Manager 
    { ps aux }
        • a(All Users): Display processes of all users on the system.
        • u(User-Oriented Output): Display processes in user-friendly format
        • x(Without Conttrolling Terminal): Includes processes that do not have Conttrolling Terminal

    Here's how to run a process, keep it running, and then kill it:
        Step 1 ::==
            start a long-running process    
                eg:- 
                    sleep 1000 &
                        [ The '&' runs the process in the background ]
                        [ The terminal return a Process ID(PID) ]
        
        Step 2 ::==
            Check running processes
                eg:- 
                    ps aux | grep sleep
        
        Step 3 ::==
            Kill the Process
                eg:- 
                    Kill <PID>
            Forcefully shutdown
                eg:-
                    kill -9 <PID>

To check ram utilization :- { free -m }
